You may feel free to re-release your code to sourceforge under the
LGPL in this case. Ordinarily, the LGPL allows incorporation into
proprietary products and so that might raise an eyebrow here about the
intended use. If it is going to be a commercial product that earns
revenue, you and Brown should be paid for the developed code. But in
this case it is a free SourceForge project so our office sees no
reason not to enable whatever implementation they want that you are
willing to provide.
